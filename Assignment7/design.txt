Assignment 7 - Design

1. Pick a generic object where something could cause an exception in its state:
    For this assignment I will be creating a basic program that uses a generic
    object called "Animal". This object will have specific exception states.

2. Describe a generic exception that could happen in your object.
    - AnimalDies - If animal dies - exception is called
    - AnimalExhaustion - If max energy is exceeded - exception is called

3. Describe two subclasses of the object.
    - Bear: Is a mammal, exists on land, has a max speed, has claws
    - Salmon: Is a fish, exists in water, cannot exist out of water, has a max speed
    - Eagle: Is a bird, can fly and walk, has two movement options, has a max speed

4. Describe two subclasses of the exception.
    - AnimalDies:
        AnimalStarves - If animal doesn't eat over several cycles it dies.
        AnimalDiesInCombat - If animal fights with another animal and HP reaches 0, it dies.

5. Draw an inheritance diagram that shows the relationships between the various classes and exceptions
