1. Attempt to add file reading and writing to their program:
    When looking through my partners code search for #[$] to find
    the areas of code that I attempted to add.

    I was unable to fully incorporate file I/O. This was fairly difficult
    because the code was relatively complex and requires some reorganization 
    in order to incorporate file I/O with more efficiency.

2. Identify sections of their code that you think could be made into methods or funcitons
    When looking through my partners code search for #[!] to find 
    the areas of code that I thought could be turned into funcitons

3. What tests would you use to show that their programming is working correctly?
    

4. If you have these installed, run pydocstyle or pycodestyle
    There were a number of missing docstrings and other code style corrections
    that were recommended. This was the first time that I've used these programs
    and I really like it. I think both my partner and I could work to make our code
    stylized more like these standardizations.
