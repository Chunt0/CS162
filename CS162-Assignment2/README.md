# CS162-Assignment2

For this assignment I am attempting to build a Neural Network to recognize handwritten digits.
This is using the notorious MNIST data set. Much of this project is being build through my 
investigations into ML, using several key resources: Michael Nielsons book "Neural Networks
and Deep Learning" and the videos by 3Blue1Brown.

This week I will be highlighting my work on the file input functions and the menu selection
function within my project design.

Comments that contain start with #[*] are intended to guide the reader to the components that
satisfy this weeks assignment elements.
