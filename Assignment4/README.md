# Assignment 4

For this assignment I expanded upon the Pomodoro app we worked on in class. The 
application has several key functions. When the start button is pressed the count
down timer begins based on which interval the app is currently on. The user can pause
the timer and then the user can start the timer over. There is also a reset button
which places the interval counter back to 1. 

In addition to these core functions, there are three user entry fields, each with
a corresponding button. The user is able to define the STUDY, SHORT, and LONG 
variables, thus changing the times the timer starts from. 

There is also a next button which increments the interval counter by 1 and resets
it to 1 when the interval counter is currently at 8.

The exit button allows the user to cleanly exit the program.

How to run program:
===================
- git clone the repo to your local machine
- Navigate your command line to the directory containing pomodoro_app.py
- Enter: python3 pomodoro_app.py

The directory PomodoroPics contains screenshots of each function. You can't visually
see anything when the reset button is pressed but it works!

There is additionally a directory called wordl. This is an attempt to build my owns
Wordle app called LDROW. We'll see if it works, check out the README in that directory
to get the scoop.
