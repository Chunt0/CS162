1. What does your program do? 
    My project is my version of the New York Times word guessing game Wordle.
    In this game you attempt to guess a secret 5-letter word. Every letter that 
    is correct in both letter and position is shown as green, if the letter is 
    correct but in the wrong position it is shown as yellow. The player has 6
    guesses.

2. Think of different components of your program.
    I will be using tkinter as the GUI module. I will need to make classes for the
    various labels and buttons, then a class that pulls them all together. I will
    need a wordlist of 5-letter words that the game can use for the secret word 
    and to check if the player guesses an appropriate word.

3. What is the structure of your program?
    Generate secret word -> wait for user input -> compare user input to secret
    word -> score players guess appropriately -> return score and update scoreboard
    
4. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research?
    I will primarily be needing to learn how to use tkinter. I'm still unfamiliar
    with how it all works to make a clean GUI.

5. What libraries may be useful to learn?
    tkinter

6. What tests should do to make sure each part of your program works?
    Make sure guess word scoring works properly.
